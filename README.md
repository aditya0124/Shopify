# Shopify - Front-End Internship Assignment

## Project Overview

This project is a simple shopping website built using **React.js** and the **Fake Store API**. The website includes features like login authentication, product listing, product details, cart management, and checkout functionality. The project demonstrates how to integrate APIs, manage state, and create a responsive, modern front-end.

## Features

1. **Login Page**
   - Form with username and password.
   - Authentication using Fake Store API's `/auth/login` endpoint.
   - Stores JWT token in localStorage.
   - Redirects to product listing page on successful login.

2. **Product Listing Page (Home)**
   - Fetches and displays all products using the `/products` endpoint.
   - Filters products by category using `/products/category/:category` endpoint.
   - Includes a search bar for product search (optional).
   - Responsive grid layout optimized for mobile-first design.

3. **Product Detail Page**
   - Displays full product information (image, title, description, price).
   - Includes an "Add to Cart" button.

4. **Cart Page**
   - Displays products added to the cart.
   - Allows users to update quantity or remove items.
   - Shows total price.
   - Checkout button clears the cart and shows a confirmation message.

5. **Header / Navigation**
   - Links: Home | Cart | Logout.
   - Displays cart item count.
   - Logout clears JWT token and redirects to the Login page.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (Vite or CRA)
- **Routing**: React Router v6+
- **State Management**: React Hooks (Context API for cart state management)
- **Styling**: Plain CSS
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
